Join us in this session to discover how using containers can revolutionize your Python development workflow. You\u2019ll learn how to seamlessly define and manage external dependencies, like databases or message queues, directly in your Python code. We\u2019ll show you how to automate the creation and teardown of these dependencies, enabling you to run reliable, consistent integration tests across all environments\u2014whether you're on Windows, macOS, or Linux. By the end of this session, you\u2019ll understand how to set up isolated testing environments that eliminate environment-specific issues and ensure that every test starts with a clean slate. We\u2019ll also dive into advanced features like parallel CI execution and containerized database instances, so you can start your tests with a known, controlled state every time. When you leave this session, you\u2019ll have the tools and knowledge to enhance your Python development process, collaborate more effectively with your team, and accelerate the delivery of high-quality software.
