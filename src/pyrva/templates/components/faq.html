{#
Frequency Asked Questions component

This uses some more advanced Jinja features to create a reusable FAQ component. This component is used to display a list
of questions and answers. Each question is a details element that can be toggled open and closed. The answers are hidden
until the question is clicked.

You have to "call" the macro with the parameters. By creating a call context, the content in side the call block will be
rendered inside the macro. This allows you to pass in the content for each question and answer.

            {% call faq('I see you have a YouTube channel, are meetings recorded?') %}
            <p>
                In the past, PyRVA has recorded meetings and posted them to our
                <a class="font-semibold text-blue-600" href="{{ url_for('youtube') }}">YouTube channel</a>.
                However, we do not record our meetings by default as we found it detracted from the in-person
                experience.
